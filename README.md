My TE Seminar mini project

* This is my third year mini project.
* Flask (Python web development framework) used for webpages.
* SVM (Support Vector Machines) used for training and classification purposes.
* Self-generated data set of upto 10000 instances

Steps:
1. First make suure you have flask installed, if not enter the following command in terminal:
''' pip install Flask '''.
2. After installing flask, extract the contents in a folder and then run the '''__init__.py''' file.
3.  Server runs at ''' localhost:5000 ''', type this address in the browser and see the SVM in action.
